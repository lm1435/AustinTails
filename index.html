                        <p>
                            Prior to founding Texas Tails ATX, I worked in marketing and public health in the NYC Metro area for nearly 10 years. Despite my experience and education, an MPH in Health Education and Behavioral Sciences, I was no longer interested in corporate America
                            and all that entailed.
                            <br /><br /> I have always been asking myself what I love to do, and what my passion is. I have many, but what could I translate into a rewarding career that helps people...AND ANIMALS? Now I aim to provide the most personalized
                            and professional pet sitting and dog walking service that people can rely and depend on.
                            <br /><br /> I have worked as a vet receptionist at The Central Texas Cat Hospital in Round Rock and as a Kennel Tech at Austin Pets Alive! I have fostered over 40 cats for APA! And currently live with my 3 black kitties named
                            Charlie, Ellemenopee, and Vader. My other two favorite animals are my husband, Casey, and our Great Dane Muppet ;)

                        <p>
                            Casey has grown up with dogs his whole life, specifically Great Danes. The current love of his life is his Dane Muppet, who he even got tattooed on his leg! Casey loves all dogs and has a natural way with making them comfortable and relaxed in all situations.
                            When he is not playing with Mupps or walking your pups he is a musician and works in sales at Autonation selling cars. Casey grew up with cats, dogs, birds, sugar gliders and fish. Caring for your pets is a top priority, and
                            he is glad to be there for them while you’re away.

                        <p>
                            Hi! I have been passionate about helping and caring for people and animals for as long as I can remember. It is incredibly exciting to have a job doing what you love!<br><br> I was born in Southern California and relocated
                            here with my family before I started high school. I graduated from the University of Texas in Austin, where I have resided for the past 20 years. I have had many jobs, including band management, service industry, and “the office
                            job” at an insurance brokerage. For the past 3 years, I was the General Manager for a restaurant in town. These experiences have all taught me so many things, including how much people, including myself, love, care for, and
                            miss their animals while they are away. It is an amazing thing to be able to go care for and play with these animals and give their loving owners peace of mind. I love to help teach dogs and their owners how to do tricks, too!
                            Photography is another of my passions, so I hope you enjoy the photos that I send you! =)

                      I live in Northwest Austin with my Husband and two pups that we love very much! I have always loved animals and have been looking for a way to do what I absolutely love! I went to college in San Antonio and afterwards move here into an apartment with my husband.<br>My two pups are fun and loving. Willow and Koda are our lives and there is plenty of love to share. Koda is 3 months old and I have adopted her from APA and plan to volunteer in the future for APA. I am excited to get started loving your animals almost as much as you do!

                        This is a new project that I am testing out specifically tailored for Texas Tails ATX. I know so many overweight indoor cats that need a little extra push to get the exercise they need! I will use lasers, wands, and treats to run them up and down the
                        stairs and around the apartment/house for a minimum of 10 minutes for an extra $5. I will also send you a video to show them in action! If your cat is completely uninterested I will not charge the fee but it can't hurt to give
                        it a try!
